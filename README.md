# Learning Interface Conditions in Domain Decomposition Solvers

## Installation

This code requires at least Python 3.8 to run, along with the CPU versions of PyTorch/PyTorch Geometric.  (CUDA versions can be used but are not strictly necessary)

A full list of the required Python libraries is included in `requirements.txt`.  These can all be installed by running
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Alternatively, the script `create-venv.sh` can be used to create a Python virtual environment
and install any necessary libraries into `osm-ml-venv`.  You can run this with
```
chmod +x create-venv.sh
./create-venv.sh
```
then, activate the virtual environment with `source osm-ml-venv/bin/activate`.

## Training

Use `train.py` to train the model:
```
python train.py
```
A full list of arguments can be found by running with `--help`.  A pre-trained model is also included as `trained_model.pth`.

## Testing

Run the evaluation script with
```
python test.py
```
A full list of arguments can be found by running with `--help`.
